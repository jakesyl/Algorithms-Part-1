Analysis:

Different roles:
*Programmer
*Client
*Theoretician
*Basic blocking

Running time: 

Analytic engine, number of cranks (modern cpu cycles)

Reasons to analyze algorithsm:

*Performance Prediction
*gurantee performance
*Compare algorithms

*Understand theoretical basis
*Aviod performance bugs


FFT algorithm:

basis of dvd jpeg mri
n^2 vs nlog(n)
N^2 brute force

N-Body simulation
Easy: N^2
N log(n) enables new research 

Scientific method to analyze performance

* Observe
* Prediction
* Hypothesize
* Verify
* Validate

Principles
* Expect it to be reproducable (easy on a pc)
* Hypotheses must be falsifiable

Vid 2:
First step is making observations:

Given N distinct integers how many triples sum to zero

Triples that sum to exactly zero

Stack method count:

triple for loop 
brute force algorithm

empirical analysis, mesure running time
quadratic curve
log log plot

Running time is 10.006 x 10 -10 x N 2.999^3

Ratio of running time for n 2n  (lg ratio)
