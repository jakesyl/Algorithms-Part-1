*Scientific Approach:

Build mathematical models
do experiments to validate models


*Problem
Given a set of N objects (o-n)
*Union Command: connect two objects

Command model:

connected(0,7)
union(5,0)

*Doesn't state path, but tells if a path

Applications:

* Photo pixels
* Networks
* Social Networks
* Circut Elements
* Variable names
* Mettalic sites in a composite system


Convenient to name objects 0 to n
Use integers as array index
suppress details not relevant to union find
