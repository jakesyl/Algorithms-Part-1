Here is some information to help you interpret the assessment report. See the Assessment Guide for more details.
Compilation: we compile your .java files using a Java 7 compiler. Any error or warning messages are displayed and usually signify a major defect in your code.
Style: we run checkstyle to automatically checks the style of your Java programs. Here is a list of available Checkstyle checks, which you can use to help decode any warning messages.
Bugs: we run findbugs to check for common bug patterns in Java programs. A warning message strongly suggests a bug in your code but occasionally there are false positives. Here is a summary of bug descriptions, which you can use to help decode warning messages.
API: we check that your code exactly matches the prescribed API (no extra methods and no missing methods). If it does not, no further tests are performed.
Correctness: we perform a battery of unit tests to check that your code meets the specifications.
Memory: we determine the amount of memory according to the 64-bit memory cost model from lecture.
Timing: we measure the running time and count the number of elementary operations.
